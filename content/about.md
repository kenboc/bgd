I am working with intelligent space management at a local Danish authority, including solutions involving hybrid technologies of relational and non-relational data, IoT, Data Lake, and Azure cloud. My whole career, I have been working with Facility Management on operational and strategic level.

My wife Stine and I reside in Hillerød.
